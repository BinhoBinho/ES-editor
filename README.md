# ES-editor
This is my very first project, so I'm not quite sure of what I'm doing.

Made this so I could learn about some concepts in C such as memory allocation, pointers and file i/o.

It's a very simple text editor used in the command line, but it lacks some functionalities, so it is not fully complete.
